## Control Flow Logic and Program Structuring

Control flow in programming determines the order in which statements are executed based on conditions or loops. Understanding control flow is crucial for structuring programs that make decisions and perform repeated tasks effectively.

### Conditional Statements
- Conditional statements help in decision-making by allowing different code paths based on conditions. They enable the program to execute certain blocks of code only when specific criteria are met, leading to more dynamic and interactive programs.

### Looping Structures
- Looping structures allow repeated execution of code, making programs more efficient by reducing redundancy. They enable you to perform tasks multiple times without writing repetitive code, which is essential for tasks that require iteration.

Together, these concepts form the foundation of program control flow, enabling developers to:
1. **Make Decisions**: Using conditional statements to choose between different courses of action.
2. **Perform Repeated Tasks**: Utilizing loops to execute code multiple times, based on specific conditions.

By mastering control flow logic, you can write more structured, efficient, and maintainable code.
